# Project Axis ‚Äî Phase 2: Security Monitoring Tools

This repository is part of **Project Axis**, documenting my cybersecurity journey.  
Phase 2 focuses on building security monitoring skills, including authentication monitoring, process monitoring, port scanning, and network activity logging.

All scripts include safety checks and anonymization for privacy, and are fully documented with example outputs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

### 1. auth_monitor.sh
**Purpose:** Monitors failed login attempts and logs them for review.  
**Learning Focus:** Authentication monitoring, log parsing, anonymization.  
**Examples:**  
- ![auth_monitor_code](examples/auth_monitor_code.png)  
- ![auth_monitor_before](examples/auth_monitor_before.png)  
- ![auth_monitor_after](examples/auth_monitor_after.png)

### 4. proc_watch.sh
**Purpose:** Monitors running processes and records changes over time.  
**Learning Focus:** Process auditing, system activity logging, automation.  
**Examples:**  
- ![proc_watch_code](examples/proc_watch_code.png)

## üìå Notes
- All outputs have been anonymized for safe public posting.  
- Phase 2 demonstrates security monitoring and system auditing skills.  
- Future phases of Project Axis will build on this foundation:  
  - Defensive Security Tools  
  - Intrusion Detection & Response  
  - Ethical Hacking Labs
